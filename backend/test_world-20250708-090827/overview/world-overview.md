**The Realm of Aethros**

Welcome to Aethros, a mystical realm where ancient magic flows through crystalline ley lines that crisscross the land like veins of pure energy. This world exists in a delicate balance between the mortal kingdoms and the ethereal Shadowlands that bleed through at twilight.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Magic System**: Aethric energy can be channeled through crystal focuses, but overuse causes "crystal burn" - a dangerous condition where magic users' bodies begin to crystallize
- **Geography**: Three main continents separated by the Misty Seas, connected by floating stone bridges maintained by ancient magic
- **Atmosphere**: A world caught between ages - crumbling ruins of a great civilization stand alongside bustling medieval towns, while mysterious phenomena hint at powers beyond mortal understanding

**Core Elements:**
- The Sundering: A cataclysmic event 500 years ago that shattered the old empire and created the Shadowlands
- Crystal Wardens: Elite guardians who maintain the ley line network
- The Twilight Courts: Mysterious beings from the Shadowlands who emerge at dusk to make bargains with mortals
- Ancient Artifacts: Powerful relics from the pre-Sundering era, scattered and largely forgotten

The world pulses with untold stories, from humble village tales to epic quests that could reshape the very fabric of reality.
